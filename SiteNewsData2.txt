Schrödinger's cat simultaneously has 3 million, 0 and an annoying 301 views on YouTube. (@UltimateHurl)

Every time I hear a joke about Schrödinger's cat a little part of me dies and simultaneously doesn't die. (@GeorgeGavin1)#

Posted By:Saadman#Last Modified at:03/02/2019 01:18:28###New Post:It is a thought experiment. So the cat never exists, it only exists in Schrodinger’s mind. It is just like my girlfriend, only exist in my mind.

Imagine you put the cat into a box containing an explosive. This explosive has 50% chance to explode and 50% chance of doing nothing. The only way for you to know it is when you open the box.

When you open the box, the cat is either dead or alive. There is 50% chance that the cat is dead and 50% chance the cat is alive.

When you leave the box close, the cat can be both dead and alive. It is called Superposition in Quantum Mechanics.#

I know you have a crush right now. But you want to know whether the person likes you back right? Sometimes you would pick up signs that the person likes you, but sometimes you think that you have made some fatal errors that the person would hate you forever.

This is called Superposition! You think the person likes and hates you at the same time.

How to get rid of this? Open the box to find out whether the cat is dead or alive. Or in other words, confess your feeling to find out he/she really like you.

Yes, your curiosity may kill the cat or in this case your feelings. But do you really want to stuck in Superposition stage forever til you can’t move on with your life?

I am sure you don’t want.#
